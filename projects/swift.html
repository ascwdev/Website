                Swift is a bot application designed to be used with Discord. It was originally created to help me understand JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                It boasts a robust command handler that makes use of Discord's built in slash command GUI to display commands in an effective and elegant way.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project began with a simple set of commands for paging user & role information, and then expanded to include commands relating to server moderation, making use of the Discord API's BitField permissions system to condition commands based on user permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the project grew in scope, it introduced me to new concepts such as JSON data handling, and using those techniques to fetch data from various APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond that, I've since used JSON to retrieve information for this website, and generally this project has improved my ability with how JavaScript & JSON work.
